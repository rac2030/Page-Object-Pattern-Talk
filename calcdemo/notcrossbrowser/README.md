# HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript calculator

This was a small project we did just to play around with some of the 
latest web tools, such as KnockoutJS. We wanted to design and build 
something that looked clean, used no images and with a small amount of code.

The result was a simple calculator built with pure CSS and a little bit
of JavaScript and [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) love.

The calculator also has keyboard support through your keyboard numpad.

## Demo
We published [a demo](http://ideaviate.com/projects/calculator) where you can 
try the calculator online. The demo is also included if you clone the repo.
